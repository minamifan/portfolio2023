            The background of the poster is a person holding a flashlight to search. 
            The picture and text echo each other. The stars in the sky give people a visual impact.
             The font is chosen to be lively, which is very suitable for young audiences.

        <p>
            This business card is one I made for myself. 
            The design of the entire business card mainly revolves around my personality. 
            I am a lively and cheerful person with many faces, 
            so I used strong contrasting color matching in the business card, 
            and in the design of my own name, the letter e is slanted. 
            It can better reflect my lively personality.
