            This poster is a promotional poster for a charity. The posters are mainly aimed at young people who are severely depressed in life. 
            <br> purpose is to help these young people regain confidence in life and provide some solutions for young people to face life positively. 
            <br> it is a healing poster, I chose positive colors and lively typography to create a relaxed and lively atmosphere.

        <p>
            This business card is one I made for myself. 
            The design of the entire business card mainly revolves around my personality. 
            I am a lively and cheerful person with many faces, 
            so I used strong contrasting color matching in the business card, 
            and in the design of my own name, the letter e is slanted. 
            It can better reflect my lively personality.

            This poster is a public welfare poster, calling on people not to abandon their pets. 
            <br>The cat image in the poster is pieced together with the cat's facial features and limbs, 
            <br>without obvious outlines, which can give users room for imagination. 
            <br>The image of the cat can play a role of segmentation in the poster, 
            <br>which can divide the text left and right.
